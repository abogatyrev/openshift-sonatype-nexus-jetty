{"name":"Openshift-sonatype-nexus-jetty","tagline":"Openshift Sonatype Nexus DIY Cartridge","body":"Openshift Sonatype Nexus DIY Cartridge\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThe problem with other Openshift Nexus projects boil down to three main problems: disk usage, little documentation, or war distributions. This [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/) cartridge facilitates running a lightweight application (less than 100 MB to start) by storing only the [Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/) configurations and deployment. The build hook will automatically download and configure the Sonatype Nexus Jetty bundle distribution. The start hook script is the only custom code needed to run this application.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart: Deploy from GitHub\r\n\r\n1. Under the Openshift Applications tab, click `Create your first application now` link or the `Add Application` button.\r\n2. Create a `Do-It-Yourself 0.1` application.\r\n3. After selecting your public URL, paste the GitHub **HTTP** repository clone URL. (Just remove the `S` from the HTTPS repository clone URL)\r\n\r\n\thttp://github.com/bretkikehara/openshift-sonatype-nexus-jetty\r\n\r\n4. Wait a few minutes while the application is built.\r\n5. Login to the Sonatype Nexus application using the default user `admin` and password `admin123`.\r\n\r\n## Sonatype Nexus\r\n\r\n[Sonatype Nexus](http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/) serves as a Maven repository.\r\n\r\nCurrent Deploy Version: ***2.8.1-01*** community edition\r\n\r\nThe deploy version can be changed by setting the version in the `.openshift/action_hooks/build` script.\r\n\r\n## Openshift\r\n\r\nAll hooks are available under the `.openshift/action_hooks` directory.\r\n\r\n### Build Hook\r\nCurrently, the build hook downloads the the Nexus bundle and then proceeds to deploy it to `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR`. This can be changed by updating the `NEXUS_VERSION` in the `.openshift/action_hooks/build` script. When the version has been changed, any existing version of the nexus deployment will be deleted. Of course, the `sonatype-work` directory will be left untouched.\r\n\r\nAfter the Sonatype Nexus has been deployed, then a copy of `sonatype-work` directory is made in the `$OPENSHIFT_DATA_DIR` if the directory does not exists. Otherwise, this folder will not be touched across deployments.\r\n\r\nOn every push to Openshift, the project configurations in the `conf` directory will always be copied to the nexus deployment directory.\r\n\r\n### Start Hook\r\n\r\nThe following environment variables are set in the start hook:\r\n\r\n\tNEXUS_APPLICATION_PORT\r\n\tNEXUS_APPLICATION_HOST\r\n\tNEXUS_CONTEXT_PATH\r\n\tNEXUS_WORK\r\n\tNEXUS_HOME\r\n\r\nWhen running the Sonatype Nexus application, anything that is printed to the System.out is captured in the `$OPENSHIFT_DIY_LOG_DIR/out.log` file.\r\n\r\n### Stop Hook\r\n\r\nRuns the kill command to stop the server.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is available under the MIT License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
